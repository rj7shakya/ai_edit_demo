          The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the creative
          industry and offering new solutions to simplify traditional and
          complex tasks. This program uses artificial intelligence to automate
          the video editing process, with a focus on removing silence and bad
          takes. The workflow starts by extracting audio from a video file and
          then producing a text of the dialogue. This text is processed using
          the model, which edits the text by removing fumbles, repetitions and
          other errors, resulting in a clearer and better version. In parallel,
          word- level alignment is performed on the text to accurately map each
          word to its timestamp in the video. The clean text generated by the
          model is used to filter and remove unwanted parts from the scanned
          transcript. By doing this, you will always have relevant and quality
          content. This method not only increases the accuracy and speed of
          video editing, but also reduces the manual effort required, allowing
          content creators to focus on the creative aspects of their work.
          Incorporating artificial intelligence into this approach shows the
          potential of automation to transform video editing, making it more
          efficient and accessible.
